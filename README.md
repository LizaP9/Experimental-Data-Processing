# Experimental Data Processing Course - Assignments

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to the assignments from the **Experimental Data Processing** course. The course focuses on practical approaches to data processing for control and forecasting, with an emphasis on uncovering hidden features and regularities in dynamical processes using experimental data.

## Course Description
The course introduces students to useful methods for processing experimental data, with applications in navigation, solar physics, geomagnetism, and space weather research.

## Topics Covered
1. **Data Processing for Control and Forecasting**: Techniques for predicting system behavior based on historical data.
2. **State-Space Models**: Statistical approaches for modeling complex processes.
3. **Parameter Identification**: Methods for extracting key parameters from experimental data to reveal hidden regularities.
4. **Applications**: Practical examples in navigation, solar physics, geomagnetism, space weather, and biomedical research.

## Repository Structure
- `/code`: Contains solutions to each assignment, Python code.
- `/reports`: Reports on completed tasks.
- `/datasets`: Experimental datasets used for various tasks in the assignments.
- `/final_project`: Contains description, solution and presentation on final group project of the course.

## How to Use
Clone the repository to explore the solutions and follow along with the assignments:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LizaP9/Experimental-Data-Processing.git
```

Note: it is necessary to replace the paths to the data files before running the code.
